# Password Generator

  

## Description

This project allows a user to generate a random password within the parameters they select with a push of a button.

## Features

I've included the features below using:

- User is able to select the amount of characters they want (btw 8 - 128 characters).

- User is able to select the type of character they want to include (number, upper and lowercase letter, and special characters).

  

What's to come:

- Instead of using prompts I will make the user interface smoother by using checkboxes:
	- Using check boxes instead of confirm
	- Adding a slider option that allows the user to select how many characters they desire.
	
- Putting all customizations items in one box that allows the user to select and unselect without having to go through the entire process

- Adding a copy to clipboard function
